Secure by default cloud infrastructure configuration using the Terraform CDK.

[Documentation](./API.md)

## Install üì•

Install the library

### Typescript/Javascript

```shell
npm install @slalombuild/fusion-cdk
```

## Usage ‚ö°Ô∏è

####

Getting started with the Fusion CDK library is almost exactly like using the terraform cdk constructs you're already used to. Each construct is a light wrapper around the original provider with some opinionated security constraints added on.

```typescript
import { App, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
import * as fusion from "@slalombuild/fusion-cdk";
import { security } from "@slalombuild/fusion-cdk/@types";

const app = new App();

const stack = new TerraformStack(app, "cdktf-constructs-demo");

new fusion.S3Bucket(stack, "bucket", {
  // You can opt out of security controls 
  // by explicitly marking your property as insecure
  encryptionKey: security.NOT_SECURE,
});

app.synth();
```
